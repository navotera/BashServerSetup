It is recommended to use [screen](https://www.howtogeek.com/662422/how-to-use-linuxs-screen-command/) to inititate the installation process due to the installation may take more than 30 minutes (depend on computing power of server)

### Apache2/Nginx setup

1. Add your public ssh key first : 
```
mkdir ~/.ssh/ && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys 
```
```
vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

2. Download the script 

```unix
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/navotera/BashServerSetup/master/init.sh && chmod +x init.sh
```

3. Run the script in screen (it takes quite long to install all the things)
```unix 
apt install screen && screen
```

```unix
./init.sh | tee /var/log/bashServerSetup_install
```

4. Exit screen and you can leave the PC : 

CTRL+A+D 


5. Later if you want to enter the screen 
```
screen -r 
```

## Run specific ansible playbook : 
```unix
ansible-playbook /var/BashServerSetup/playbook/init.yml
```

## After success installing 
1. Access password on **server.config** or Change passsword ```sudo -i passwd```  
2. Change the hostname by using command ```hostname YOUR_HOSTNAME``` [optional]
3. Start the webmin ```service webmin start``` and access to **https://ip_address:9191**
4. PHPMyadmin Start by ```service pamin start``` access to **https://ip_address:9292**


## ModSecurity installation (if failed)
if you want install Modsecurity you can run this : 

```ansible-playbook /var/BashServerSetup/app/modsecurity/apache2/install.yml``` --> for **Apache**

```ansible-playbook /var/BashServerSetup/app/modsecurity/nginx/install.yml``` --> for **Nginx**
